### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During the day, I am a PhD student at the University of Vaasa, Finland. My PhD dissertation focuses (broadly speaking) on algebraic methods for positioining. I have experience with several computational algebraic geometry techniques and softwares.  

During night, I am the core developer and maintainer of [IntervalLinearAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalLinearAlgebra.jl) a package for numerical linear algebra using interval arithmetic. More over, I am also co-maintainer and co-developer of multiple packages in the [JuliaIntervals](https://github.com/juliaintervals) organisation.

I am enthusiast about anything related to computational mathematics, from abstract formal methods to low level computer arithmetic implementations, if you have something with equations and code, then I'm interested!

I am also an ethusiast in open source and open science and try to promote awareness and importance of such practices. I am fairly involved in [Nordic-RSE](https://nordic-rse.org), a non-profit organisation to bring together and support research software engineers in the nordics and promote good open source practices in academia. 

If you want to collaborate with me, get in touch!
If you are expecting me to comment/review some issues/PRs in some repositories I am involved, feel free to ping me every 1-2 days until you get my attention.
